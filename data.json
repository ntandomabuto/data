    "aboutMe":"My name is Ntando Mabuto from Cape Town. I am a well motivated person and I push myself to get everything done. I graduated from high school in 2022. Knowledge is power and everytime I learn new things I get excited. I was introduced to the tech industry at grade ten, since then I set a new goal of being the best and a professional IT specialist. I am still new in the industry and I am working my way up, everyday is a new lesson so I am getting better with time. During my spare time I do self-studying and practising to improve my skills, things I enjoy doing are reading, drawing and playing games. Working individually is efficient but group work is done quickly, I work well within groups because different minds bring up bright ideas. I can speak two languages, Isixhosa and English",
