    "aboutMe":"My name is Ntando Mabuto from Cape Town. I am a well motivated person and I push myself to get everything done. I garduated from high school in 2022. Knowledge is power and everytime I learn new things I get excited I was introduced to the tech industry at grade ten, since then I set a new goal of being the best and a professional IT specialist. Although I am still new in the industry but everyday is a new lesson so I am getting better with time. On my free time I do self studying to improve my skills, things I enjoy doing are listening to music. Working individually is efficient but group work is done quickly, I work well within groups because different minds bring up bright ideas. I also do self motivate",
