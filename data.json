    "aboutMe":"My name is Ntando Mabuto and I was born on the 14th of February 2005. I am a well motivated person and I push myself to get everything done. Knowledge is power and everytime I learn new things I get excited. I was introduced to the tech industry at grade ten, since then I set a new goal of being the best and a professional IT specialist. I am still new in the industry but everyday is a new lesson so I am getting better with time. On my free time I do self studying to improve my skills, things I enjoy doing are listening to music. I work well within groups because different minds bring up bright ideas",
